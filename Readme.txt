Full workspace for converting the Polar Science Center's PIOMAS ocean circulation data files to point features in the NSIDC EASE North Grid projection which are then interpolated (spline) into 25k x 25k rasters of U and V vectors for each month from 1978 to 2013. Outputs are saved as ASCII matrices in the Data/PIOMAS/Processed/ASCII folder as monthly datasets, which are, in turn, convolved into daily time step ASCII files. 

See the ReadMe.txt file in the Data folder for info on the files there. 

Also, the Python scripts in the Scripts folder contain comments describing the processes used to derive these files.
